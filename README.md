# Target Pipeline with Quarto Outputs
This repository contains a targets pipeline that processes unemployment data and generates plots using Quarto. The pipeline uses the targets and tarchetypes packages to streamline the workflow and ensure reproducibility. It outputs plots for different levels of interest and compiles the results into a Quarto document.
